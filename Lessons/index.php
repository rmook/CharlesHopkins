			<p>As an instructor of trombone, my aim is to prepare my students toward a career in music rooted in integrity and passion for the arts.  “Imitate, Assimilate, Innovate,” the old adage in jazz education attributed to Clark Terry, serves as the guide to my approach as this model is a reflection of my performance preparation and experience as pupil.  This pedagogy is not just performance-driven, but acts as a catalyst in cultivating the student as teacher, fostering the ability to communicate a life-long love of music.</p>
			<p>Imitation is our musical and creative guide to sound and style.  These skills are rooted in aural tradition and fostered through score and transcription study paired with representative recordings.  To further support this cultured approach to music-making, I promote immersion in all genres, through recordings, attending live music events, and participating in a variety of ensembles.  To aid in self-evaluation, I encourage students to record their practice sessions, private lessons, and performances.</p>
			<p>As a means for assimilation, strong emphasis is placed on codified daily routines including the Brass Gym and the Michael Davis warm-up series.  These collections are adaptable to all levels of musician, and when done consistently in a class setting, provide both teacher and student with feedback on technical and musical progress.  The skills gained by regular technical practice provide the fundamentals for accurate imitation.</p>
			<p>Self assessment rooted in daily fundamental practice, coupled with a well-rounded, historically accurate approach to music-making, provide for an honest and learned approach to innovation.  I promote the quest for innovation to not just shape the final product, but guide our approach to learning.  During weekly private lessons, I offer honest progress assessment and live demonstration, with constant encouragement to strive for growth.</p>
